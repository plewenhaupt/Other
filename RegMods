A very interesting project from the Coursera Data Science Specialization. The project provided an explanation for why car makers put automatic transmissions in heavier cars and manual in lighters ones. The regression model showed that the difference in efficiency between types of transmission decreased as weight increased, and that auto was actually better in cars over 2840 lbs. 
The results of the linear regression were enlightening, interpretable and intriguing!
